# SE-Ultra-Dark-Mode

For the 2020 Stack Exchange April Fool's joke, they released
[Ultra Dark Mode](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/01/ultra-dark-mode-april-fools/?cb=1).
However, this amazing theme only lasts until April 5th and is only available on Stack Overflow.

Therefore, I bring this theme around all year and network-wide!

[Install] this userscript with Tampermonkey to experience Ultra Dark Mode all the time!
